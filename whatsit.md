WHATSIT? (Wow! How'd All That Stuff get In There?)

This is a very clever free-form database.  I've not seen anything like it
before or since.  It's probably not something you'd use every day, but it
is very interesting.

Before you start, you'll need to create a database file as shown below.
(I don't remember what all the commands do, but the ones shown here should
be enough to get you started).

Enjoy.
